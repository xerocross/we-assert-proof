# We-Assert-Proof

We-Assert-Proof is an assert utility for use in internally verifying statements inside scripts at runtime. One potential goal is to catch what would otherwise be silent errors, or perhaps even
to mathematically prove that an algorithm has functioned as expected. **See also We-Assert (https://github.com/xerocross/we-assert)**.

We-Assert-Proof depends on Vulcan, Version 0.4.0, (https://github.com/RyanMarcus/vulcan), which is old but appears to be stable. Aside from that dependency, it is a one-man project written and maintained by Adam Cross. If I say "we", really I'm just referring to myself.

This project was stale for a long while, but as of June 2023 I have updated its dependencies and made it presentable for possible future development. There are problems, and I haven't yet figured out how to actually use Vulcan here to implement mathematical proofs into code. That is something I want to do eventually.

## We-Assert (different project)

We-Assert-Proof is basically a fork of We-Assert V3 (https://github.com/xerocross/we-assert). I found the license of Vulcan burdensome and the assertion functionality of We-Assert does not need Vulcan, so I removed the dependency from We-Assert as of V4 and made We-Assert-Proof a separate project. See We-Assert for the assertion functionality of We-Assert-Proof without Vulcan and without the burdensome license.

## importing

We-Assert-Proof is published to NPM as `we-assert-proof`. Standard importing would look like this.
```
import WeAssertProof from "we-assert-proof"
```

The source code is at https://github.com/xerocross/we-assert-proof.

## development and deployment

To install execute `npm install`.

We-Assert-Proof is written in TypeScript. The package includes a test suite and a script for running it. Use `npm test` to run the test suite, which is written using Jest.

## copyleft license

Note the restrictive copyleft license. That was not my decision. I prefer to use the MIT license, but because Vulcan uses the highly restrictive GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, and because Vulcan is bundled with We-Assert-Proof, I was required to use a compatible license, so I used the same one. For software with just the assertion functionality of We-Assert-Proof, see my other project we-assert (v4+) instead: We-Assert https://github.com/xerocross/we-assert.

## usage


```
import WeAssertProof from "we-assert-proof";
var we = WeAssertProof.build();
```
Here ``we`` is not a singleton.  You can build as many as you want, and each has its own scope and each can be configured independently.

The most basic usage is the `that(statement, message)` function.  For example
```
we.assert.that(x < y, "x < y");
```
We recommend writing messages that are positive assertions representing the calculation&mdash;not an error message to be thrown upon failure.

If the statement evaluates false, the weAssert handler will be called.  The handler should be a function of the form `handler : (message) => {...}`.  To define such a function, we use `we.setHandler` as in this example.
```
we.setHandler((message) => {
    throw new Error(`The following assertion failed: ${message}`);
});
```
Note how in the handler we have translated the positive assertion into an error message about exactly which assertion failed.  Of course instead of throwing an error you could just swallow it, or log it, or throw the error and log it.  You get the idea.  We-AssertProof is agnostic to handling the failure of assertions.  Handle it however you want.   

We can set the level using any of the following:
`we.setLevel("DEBUG")`, `we.setLevel("WARN")`, or  `we.setLevel("ERROR")`.  The default is "ERROR".  

A specific assertion can be assigned a level using the `atLevel` function as in this example.
```
we.assert.atLevel("WARN").that(statement, message)
```
When using this construction, the *statement* will only be evaluated if the level given ("WARN") is greater than or equal to the threshhold level defined using `weAssert.setLevel`.  The order is `DEBUG` < `WARN` < `ERROR`.  Thus, for example, if we set `weAssert.setLevel("ERROR")` and then execute
```
we.assert.atLevel("WARN").that(false, "test")
```
the handler will not be called and nothing will happen because `WARN` is not greater than or equal to the current level `ERROR`.

By contrast, if you call
```
we.assert.that(false, "test")
```
then levels play no role in the assertion.  It will be treated as an error and it will go to the handler.

### data validators

You can define arbitrary data types so long as you can pass in a function that evaluates boolean to check whether any input passes or fails. The predicate defines the data type.

The usage pattern is ``we.assert.typeOf(data).is(_tyepstring_, _message_)`` to validate a given element _data_.

```
    we.define.type("natural", (x) => isNaturalNumber(x));
    we.assert.typeOf(x).is("natural", "x is a natural");
```
The ```we``` instance does not come with any predefined types.  If you want to use the standard types you can define them in your ``we`` instance by, for example, executing this:

```we.define.type("number", (x) => typeof x === "number");```
```we.define.type("array", (x)=> Array.isArray(x));```

You can also _check_ a data element and get a boolean directly like this.  This has no side effects. If false, the handler will not be called.
```
let x = 12;
we.define.type("natural", (x) => isNaturalNumber(x));
expect(we.check.typeOf(x).is("natural")).toBe(true);
```

Putting these things together, we can define something like this:

```
we.define.type("natural", (x) => isNaturalNumber(x));
we.define.type("natural[]", function (x) {
    if (!Array.isArray(x)) {
        return false;
    } else {
        for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
            if (!we.check.typeOf(x[i]).is("natural")) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
});
expect(we.check.typeOf([2, 4, 7.5, 10]).is("natural[]")).toBe(false);
```

## to do

### handlers for different levels

We should probably have different, independent handlers for the different error levels, for DEBUG, WARN, AND ERROR. I might do that later.

### mathematical proof


I'm playing with some ideas related to logical proof. I would really like to wire automated proofs into this thing, but I have not cracked it yet.

### documentation

There is more functionality in We-Assert-Proof that I have not documented here yet. I need to add more documentation to this readme document.
